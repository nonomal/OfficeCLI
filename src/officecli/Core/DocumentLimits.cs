///    StackOverflowException (which escapes the top-level SafeRun handler and
///    hard-kills the process — fatal in the long-lived resident/watch servers).
///    Each recursive walker checks <see cref="MaxRecursionDepth"/> and throws a
///    friendly <see cref="CliException"/> instead.
///  - Catastrophic-regex backtracking: a user-supplied r"..." pattern against
